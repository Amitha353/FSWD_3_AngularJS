Single Page Application
---------------------------
Web application or web site that fits in a single page.
-> No need to reload the entire page.
-> User experience like a native desktop application.
-> Most resources are retrieved with single page load.
-> Redraw parts of the page when needed without requiring a full server roundtrip.

Challenges in SPA
-----------------------
i. Search engine optimization ->  If you have search engines that crawl your website to extract data and index information, then SPA might not be a cooperative, cause the view is rendered on the fly all this cannot be preconstructed as the user interacts with the website.

Some crawlers have enough resources to navigate through resources of single data applications and index style.

Also much of the rendering work is offloaded of the client side rather than the server side. So the server is pretty much acting as a data source and nothing more than that.

In traditional websites,the server would be rendering the HTML.

ii. Partitioning the responsibility between client and server.

iii. Maintaing history.

iv. Analytics.

v. Speeding up the initial page load.
