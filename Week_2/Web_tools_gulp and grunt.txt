Web Tools -> Task runners -> Grunt and Gulp

-> Web development involves a lot od repetitive tasks, every time a change is made in a HTML osra CSS file it must be recompiled and minify it , or concatenate a bunch of files in order to create the concated file.

->Principle behind the task runners is to make the repetitve tasks easy to perform.
DRY(do not repeat yourself) principle.

Therefore the need to build tools for automated tasks.
------------
Some of the repeatitive tasks trhat should be performed.

*CSS Tasks
---------
i. compiling sass or less into css.
ii. running autoprefixer to add any vendor prefixes that are needed.
iii. minification -> removes unnecessary characters (white spaces, newlines, comments) from source code without comprimising functionality.
iv. concatenation


*Javascript Tasks
---------------
i. JSHint: - Checking Javascript code for error and potential problems (static code analysis).
ii. Concatenation 
iii. Uglification - minification + mangling(reduce local variables to single letters).
iv. Rechecking errors.

*Other tasks
----------
i.  Images -> optimizing files to reduce file sizes.
ii. Watch -> mechanism for changes in files and automatically rerunning tasks.
iii. Server and Livereload
iv. Testing
v.  Building your site for deployment.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Task Runners

-> For the above scenarios task runners are essential.
-> Configure the task once, and rerun it automatically as many times as needed.
-> several task runners are -> Grunt, Gulp, Cake, Brunch, Broccoli;
-> Build systems for the web.

* Grunt -> Configuration over code -> configure all tasks ahead of time abd then grunt takes care of it.
* Gulp -> code over configuration -> create tasks by writing code and it allows you to run, less emphasis on configuration.
