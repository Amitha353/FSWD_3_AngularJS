Angular Testing
----------------
-> Angular was implemented in a modular fashion - Angular applications consist of controllers, filters, factories, services and providers, etc..;

-> Dependency Injection;

Test-Driven Development
---------------------------
-> Write an automated test case defining the desired functionality;
-> Write application code to pass the test;
-> Refactor the code to meet coding standard;

Unit Testing
----------------
-> Testing Individual Units of code
* Restricted to verifying if the component's logic is implemented correctly;

-> Isolating the unit under test from other dependencies is important
* Dependency injection enables us to inject mock dependencies;
* Clear separation in Angular between the DOM and logic through the use of $scope;

Controllers don't directly manipulate the DOM, instead controllers put data onto the scope, and then through angular, it takes care of reflecting changes to the DOM, and vice versa;

------------------------------------
Jasmine
----------
Behavior driven development framework for Javascript;
*adopted to test Angular application;
*Use "describe" function to group our tests;
*Use "it" function to define individual tests;

Example
---------
describe('Controller:MenuController', function() {
	it('should create "dishes" with 2 dishes fetched from xhr', function() {
		expect(scope.showMenu).toBeTruthy();
	});
});
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Karma
----------
Javascript based command line tool (NodeJS application)

- Allows you to specify your tests using Jasmine and spawns a web server and automatically load your application's source code;

- Executes your tests in the browser;
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
angular-mock
------------
Many of the modules/components are dependent on others;
When tests are being carried out , some of these components may be mocked to supply pre-determined data to carry out angular test;

Angular ngMock -> module provides mocking support for your tests;

-> Inject and mock Angular services within unit tests;
-> Make asynchronous modules execute synchronously to make it easier to execute test;
-> $httpBackend lets us mock XHR request in tests;

-> beforeEach function takes in parameters that will be needed prior or beforehand;
